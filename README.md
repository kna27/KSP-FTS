>A flight termination system mod for Kerbal Space Program

When you abort a flight by pressing backspace in Kerbal Space Program, the entire rocket will explode, simulating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_safety" target="_blank">Flight Termination System</a>.

**USAGE TIPS**

- To toggle the mod on or off, press alt+a
- By default whenever you open the game, the mod will be on
- Incase you accidentally trigger an abort, a quicksave is made so you can just reload it
